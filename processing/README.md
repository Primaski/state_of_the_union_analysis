## Purpose of this folder
The purpose of this folder is to store the files generated by the scripts in /scripts/. These folders are populated on my system, but they're empty shells on GitHub for the sake of preserving space. The actual results will be exported in /findings/, so keeping it here is redundant. However, the folders were still preserved for presentation purposes on GitHub.

If you want to replicate the contents of these folders, run main.sh on your local machine.
