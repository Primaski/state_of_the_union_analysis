# text_tools_project

## Topic
**The scope of this project is to analyze U.S. presidential State of the Union addresses to identify trends in political rhetoric, reflecting the nation's concerns and interests over time, as well as any noteworthy shifts in presidential speech mannerisms. This is primarily intended to be a quantitative analysis, by capturing the frequencies and trends of relevant political keywords. The scope of this project may be narrowed or expanded, based on my findings and the timeframe I have to work with.**
